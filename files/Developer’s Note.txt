Welcome to ExpressPad.

This is a minimal note-taking application built with Node.js, Express, and the file system.
There’s no database, no cloud sync, and no unnecessary complexity — just plain text files doing their job.

This project focuses on:

Understanding backend routing

Working with the file system

Clean UI with purposeful interactions

Keeping things simple and readable

Notes created here are meant for learning and experimentation, not long-term storage.
If you’re reading this, feel free to delete it and create your own notes.

Sometimes, simple tools are the best tools.
